## Introduction

I have chosen to replicate Rentzsch and Gross’ (2015) work on looking at dispositional envy on state envy in didactic interactions (study 5). For my first year project, I am interested in studying the methods used to elicit envy to examine if they are truly eliciting what they claim to be (i.e., is this method making you envious or another corollary negative emotion). In refining envy manipulations, we can 1) better understand the boundaries between envy and other negative emotions and 2) make sure we are truly measuring what we intend to measure. Rentzsch and Gross in this study use the classic game - Rock, Paper, Scissors - to measure envy of the advantaged and disadvantaged players. Replicating this study will give us more information about different methods available to our lab for future envy research. Additionally, I can gain insight on the feasibility for this method online, as that is the primary research method our lab uses. 

This study was originally an in-person experiment, but for the purposes of this replication, I will transfer this design to being online. For the procedures, there is a pre-game questionnaire measuring dispositional envy using DSES and social desirability using BIDR. Then, the participants will play rock-paper-scissors (three times for practice and then once to decide a winner). Following the game, there will be another questionnaire to measure state emotions, thoughts about attributes (skill, luck, effect, task difficulty) on the outcome of the game, prior experience with the game, and how much they thought they could have won (pg. 542). 

There is also the obvious concern of how in person games translate to in-person games. It is possible that there is some moderation variable that comes from being in-person that is not replicated online. This game was also originally played with two participants so the analyses run used actor–partner interdependence model (APIM) analyses to control for how the partnership may have influenced any of the outcomes. I would like to discuss the pros and cons of having online participants play each other versus having a participant play a computer and control the outcomes. The former would allow for a more precise replication using APIM, but the latter could also be beneficial because it would remove that confounding factor in total. Lastly, I cannot find all of the exact questions asked online, but I am hoping with continued perusal I will be able to find all the material. If not, I will reach out to the author. 



## Methods

### Power Analysis

Original effect size, power analysis for samples to achieve 80%, 90%, 95% power to detect that effect size.  Considerations of feasibility for selecting planned sample size.

### Planned Sample

Planned sample size and/or termination rule, sampling frame, known demographics if any, preselection rules if any.

### Materials

All materials - can quote directly from original article - just put the text in quotations and note that this was followed precisely.  Or, quote directly and just point out exceptions to what was described in the original article.

### Procedure	

Can quote directly from original article - just put the text in quotations and note that this was followed precisely.  Or, quote directly and just point out exceptions to what was described in the original article.

### Analysis Plan

Can also quote directly, though it is less often spelled out effectively for an analysis strategy section.  The key is to report an analysis strategy that is as close to the original - data cleaning rules, data exclusion rules, covariates, etc. - as possible.  

**Clarify key analysis of interest here**  You can also pre-specify additional analyses you plan to do.

### Differences from Original Study

Explicitly describe known differences in sample, setting, procedure, and analysis plan from original study.  The goal, of course, is to minimize those differences, but differences will inevitably occur.  Also, note whether such differences are anticipated to make a difference based on claims in the original article or subsequent published research on the conditions for obtaining the effect.

### Methods Addendum (Post Data Collection)

You can comment this section out prior to final report with data collection.

#### Actual Sample
  Sample size, demographics, data exclusions based on rules spelled out in analysis plan

#### Differences from pre-data collection methods plan
  Any differences from what was described as the original plan, or “none”.


## Results


### Data preparation

Data preparation following the analysis plan.
	
```{r include=F}
### Data Preparation

#### Load Relevant Libraries and Functions

#### Import data

#### Data exclusion / filtering

#### Prepare data for analysis - create columns etc.
```

### Confirmatory analysis

The analyses as specified in the analysis plan.  

*Side-by-side graph with original graph is ideal here*

### Exploratory analyses

Any follow-up analyses desired (not required).  

## Discussion

### Summary of Replication Attempt

Open the discussion section with a paragraph summarizing the primary result from the confirmatory analysis and the assessment of whether it replicated, partially replicated, or failed to replicate the original result.  

### Commentary

Add open-ended commentary (if any) reflecting (a) insights from follow-up exploratory analysis, (b) assessment of the meaning of the replication (or not) - e.g., for a failure to replicate, are the differences between original and present study ones that definitely, plausibly, or are unlikely to have been moderators of the result, and (c) discussion of any objections or challenges raised by the current and original authors about the replication attempt.  None of these need to be long.
